This is an Open-Source Ninebot (and soon Xiaomi too) scooter programming interface (and diagnostics info soon too).
THIS TOOL IS ONLY FOR USE ON DEVICES YOU OWN!!!

This application is written in Python3. To install required libraries, run the following in pip:

'''pip install -r requirements.txt'''

After that, you can either run NineRiFt on your Windows, Mac, or Linux machine by opening main.py using your Python3 interpreter or you can use a prebuilt APK for Android (you could also compile a build if you want).

On Android, BLE and TCP-Serial is supported.

On, Windows, Mac, and Linux, BLE, Serial, and TCP is supported.



The Download screen is for downloading firmware:

1. Select device you need firmware for in the dropdown on the left

2. Select the firmware version you need

3. Click "Download it!" and wait for download to complete



The Flash screen is for flashing firmware:

1. (Optional) Type the first few digits or the full length of the MAC address of the target scooter for flashing

2. Select the interface you want to use to connect (if wired, plug it in first)

3. Select the part you wish to flash

4. Select the firmware file you want flashed to the target scooter. DO NOT SELECT AN MD5 FILE!!! THIS IS NOT THE FIRMWARE!!!

5. Click "Flash it!" and wait for flashing to complete



At the moment only Segway-Ninebot SNSC, ES1, ES2, and ES4 are the only supported vehicles but, Xiaomi support will be added soon.


SNSC dashboards cannot be flashed without either TCP-Serial or Serial interface.
